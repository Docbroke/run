# run
This is menu to run your applications.
You can run this from terminal or by keybinding.
When run from terminal (vt or console), it uses fzf to provide selection.
When run from window manager shortcut, it uses rofi (optionally you can use dmenu, by changing one line of code).

You can add your personal favorites to $HOME/.config/shortcuts, one per line. They will be displayed on top.
For example you can have "chromium www.google.com" or "terminator -x nnn -Rfe" in your shortcuts (one per line).
Enjoy.
